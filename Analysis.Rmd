This example comes from the final chapter of the Text Mining with R book.  Here we will use the common Usenet bulletin board dataset to run a "start to finish" analysis.  This dataset has 20,000 messages sent ot 20 Usenet boards in 1993.  The data is available at [http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) (use the `20news-bydate.tar.gz`)
